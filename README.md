## Project Description
This project allows the user to generate a professional README.md file for their given project based on their provided inputs. It was created to allow quick and consistent creation of README files for projects, especially when many projects are being created frequently (i.e for school, portfolios, etc.)

## Usage
To use, run index.js in your terminal using node. The inquirer app will query a series of questions through the terminal. Once finished, it will generate a new README.md file inside of the folder it was ran in.
